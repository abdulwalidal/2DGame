# 🎮 Java 2D Game Project (Paused)

This small project marks the beginning of my journey into **game development**.  
It may only have a few classes, but for me, it meant a lot —  
it was the first time I saw my code move, react, and feel alive.  

Seeing my code take shape and move on the screen reminded me of the creativity that first drew me to programming.

I’ve chosen to pause this project for now —
not out of disinterest, but out of purpose.
I want to come back stronger, with better skills, a clearer direction, and a real understanding of what makes games feel alive.

This repository will stay here as a small reminder of where it all began.  
One day, I’ll return to it and continue —  
piece by piece, line by line — until it becomes what I first imagined.  


Sometimes, stepping back is part of moving forward.
I’ll be back when it’s time to build something truly alive.
