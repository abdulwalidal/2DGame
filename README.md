# ðŸŽ® Java 2D Game Project (Paused)

This small project marks the beginning of my journey into **game development**.  
It may only have a few classes, but for me, it meant a lot
it was the first time I saw my code move, react, and feel alive.  

Seeing my code take shape and move on the screen reminded me of the creativity that first drew me to programming.

Iâ€™ve chosen to pause this project for now â€”
not out of disinterest, but out of purpose.
I want to come back stronger, with better skills, a clearer direction, and a real understanding of what makes games feel alive.

This repository will stay here as a small reminder of where it all began.  

Sometimes, stepping back is part of moving forward.
Iâ€™ll be back when itâ€™s time to build something truly alive.
